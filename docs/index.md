# Foreword

As you start to dwell into the world of self-hosting, you will be working with new *systems*, their *interfaces*, and the *networks* that connect them all together. It’s all so new when you’re a noob… it **will** be overwhelming at first; especially if the extent of your computer knowledge is installing Chrome. Falter not, though! You will look back one day and realize that you understand your whole infrastructure more than you ever understood your own wife’s feelings. Everything will click at some point, and the decisions that you blindly made when you were just a confused tutorial-follower will now be as clear as a glass of mud. Only then will you realize you will always be a *noob.*
