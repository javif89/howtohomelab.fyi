## Foreword

As you start to dwell into the world of self-hosting, you will be working with new *systems*, 
their *interfaces*, and the *networks* that connect them all together. 
It’s all so new when you’re a noob… it **will** be overwhelming at first; 
especially if the extent of your computer knowledge is installing Chrome. 
Falter not, though! You will look back one day and realize that you understand your 
whole infrastructure more than you ever understood your own wife’s feelings. 
Everything will click at some point, and the decisions that you blindly made when you were 
just a confused tutorial-follower will now be as clear as a glass of mud. 
Only then will you realize you will always be a *noob.* 

## Let's get going 

We aim to provide short, easy to read guides on how to start a homelab as well as
getting more familiar with homelab topics.

### Where to start

Get familiar with infrastructure basics:

- [Networking](./guides/basics/networking.md)
- [Servers](./guides/basics/servers.md)
- [Docker](./guides/basics/docker.md)

After that, get going with one of our guides. The one you choose
depends on how hardcode you want to get with your lab.

- [More robust lab](./guides/building-a-lab/more-robust-homelab.md)
