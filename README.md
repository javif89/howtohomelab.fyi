# hometohomelab.fyi

A guide for homies who want to start self-hosting to take control of their data, 
which is arguably the most valuable thing you have in life. 
Hopefully we can help you skip through the BS.

Built with the [Zensical](https://zensical.org) static site generator.

To contribute just fork and clone the repo locally, install zensical
and [just](just.systems) or use the included dev shell, 
and run `just init` then `just serve`.

## Outline of topics to cover

Each item in the list will have a status of: TODO, WIP, or WRITTEN.

- TODO: No work has been done on this.
- WIP: Currently writing, needs contribution, not complete enough yet.
- WRITTEN: Good enough to read, but can always use additions, more contributions.

### Guides

**Home page** ![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-orange)
